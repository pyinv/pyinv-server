# Assets

An asset must be either KNOWN, LOST, or DISPOSED.

If the asset is KNOWN, then the asset must have a location.

## Linked Location

An asset may have a linked location only if the asset is KNOWN and the asset model has `is_container` set to `true`.

The asset must be stored in the parent of the linked location.
